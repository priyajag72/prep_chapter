Chapter 1 Notes
***
## Listening To: "Work From Home with Hans Zimmer" on Spotify

## Before beginning:
    * Had small breakfast
    * Quick cleaned room I'm working on
    * Quick organized my desk and workspace
    * Grabbed a blanket and filled my water bottle for my comfort needs
    * Previewed the Prep Chapter website
    * Setup my repository
    * Confirmed repo and folders were all ready with premade files
    * Took a 5 minute break
    * Grabbed headphones and started music
 
## Notes for Self
* Mindset and practice are super important
* Becoming a great developer takes time, practice, patience, discipline, and determination. Everyone can do it.
* Read my own summary of recommended book "A Mind for Numbers and Deep Work"
* Ordered - arrives tomorrow
* Read through the summary - got sidetracked to the book "Daily Rituals". Previewed on Amazon, found it incredibley interesting how these famous and successful people lived. What their daily routines consisted of. It was fascinating to see what I hated, what I already do, and what I hope to model one day.
* Feeling confident about my study skills, many are already modeled on the site "Karl Booklover: A mind for numbers - summary"
* Read summary of "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Disracted World".
* Honestly - don't feel the need to purchase this one. I feel I will get a firm foundation from other recommended book.
* I don't question the reasoning behind Turing's teaching philosophy. It already aligns with my teaching pedagogy and philosophy. This was one of the reasons I chose Turing: how well informed they were in best teaching practices and how well implemented they were. The fact that they include a mod 0 now (after identifying this was needed solution) is a major selling point for me.
* Drills! This is what I was hoping for, repitiion exercises until my brain finally clicks. I worked for Starbucks for 7 years, and for 6 and half of those, I was the trainer. I was pulled to so many stores in San Antonio, I felt like I had trained a good chunk of our employee base. It was here I realized two major things: first, sheer continuous and repetitive tasks can help anyone overcome a challenge, and second, I loved sharing my knowledge and updating the way I explained things for each learners needs. I still remember my "aha moment" when my hands and arms suddenly could make drinks without thinking too hard about it. I tell that story every time I teach anything or share my knowledge. From making drinks, to teaching dance, to teaching math, to helping a coworkers, I have used this foundational skill.
